      <h2>About Revenue Grader</h2>
            <p> Revenue Grader is a <a href="#">Revenue Architects</a> application. It is a diagnostic tool to help businesses leaders rapidly assess revenue performance potential and develop a prioritized top-level plan – all in minutes. Revenue Grader complements other grader apps by taking a broad and strategic view of the critical elements of revenue performance. </p>

            <p> It is focused across three critical dimensions: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Revenue Strategy</li>
          <li>Revenue Systems</li>
          <li>Revenue Programs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After completing the Revenue Grader diagnostic, the executive can quickly identify priorities. Priorities can range widely - from developing market segmentation and crafting better value propositions to deploying marketing automation and enhancing sales team skills.<p>

        <h4>How does it work? </h4>
        <p>After a user registers, they are provided access to a very easy to use diagnostic tool. They can rate their maturity on key factors using a scale of 1-5. For each maturity factor, choose to <b>“add to plan”</b> and indicate priority.  In about 60 minutes, they will have a prioritized top-level plan indicating the items that are <b>“must do”</b>,<b> “should do” </b>and<b> “could do”</b>.  By updating the plan each quarter, the manager can see clear progression in plan execution.</p>

        <h4>Key features:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>50 Revenue Performance Factors across Revenue Strategy, Revenue Systems and Revenue Programs</li>
          <li>1-5 capability maturity scoring system</li>
          <li>Ability to quickly “add to plan” and indicate priority using “must”, “should”, “could”</li>
          <li>Compare scores with peer groups</li>
          <li>View the report and sort by maturity and priority</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We hope you find the Revenue Grader to be valuable tool for your business and a start to an effective revenue growth plan.</p>
